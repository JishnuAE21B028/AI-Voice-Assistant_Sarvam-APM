# AI-Voice-Assistant_Sarvam-APM
This is a prototype for an AI voice assistant web app that I have developed for the Sarvam AI APM product deck.

This repository contains the code for an AI Voice Assistant designed to help users learn new languages, improve grammar, and enhance vocabulary skills. The assistant combines speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech technologies to provide interactive, engaging, and personalized learning experiences.
